          The beat.bar is a study project. It has been developed in behalf of Hochschule DÃ¼sseldorf by Carlo Beckmann and Tobias Eckert for the course Musikinformatik in the SoSe 2023. This application and all its belongings, such as backend, are not (yet) meant to be published.
        </p>
        <p className={styles.consentBannerTitle}>
          This application needs to save some cookies to work properly. These cookie will fulfill the following purposes:
        </p>
        <p className={styles.consentBannerTitle}>
          We use an Unique User Identification (UUID) in form of a 16 digit number. This UUID will be used to identify the user against the Server to create and store personal playlists for the users settings.
        </p>
        <p className={styles.consentBannerTitle}>
          Furthermore we use a "Player State Cookie" to locally save the settings the user has made to his player during a session. When a user re-visits the beat.bar his player will be set as in his previous visit.
